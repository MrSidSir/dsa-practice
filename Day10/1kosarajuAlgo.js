üîß Problem: Find SCCs in directed graph 
üìù Key Point: Two pass DFS (reverse graph + original)

üí° ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:
Kosaraju's algorithm finds all Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a directed graph.
A SCC is a maximal set of vertices where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.

The algorithm works in 3 main steps:
1. First DFS: Fill vertices in stack according to their finish times
2. Create transpose/reverse graph
3. Second DFS: Process vertices from stack on reversed graph

üåç REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS:
- Software dependency analysis (circular dependencies)
- Social network analysis (finding tightly connected groups)
- Web page ranking and clustering
- Circuit design and analysis
- Compiler optimization
- Database query optimization

        // This ensures vertices with later finish times are on top

üí° DETAILED EXPLANATION:

WHY IT WORKS:
1. First DFS creates a topological ordering of SCCs
2. In the transpose graph, edges within SCCs remain within SCCs
3. Second DFS in reverse finish order ensures we process one SCC at a time

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(V + E) - Two DFS traversals
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(V) - For stack, visited array, and recursive calls

üåç REAL WORLD EXAMPLES:

1. SOFTWARE DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
   - Detect circular dependencies in modules
   - Each SCC represents a group of mutually dependent modules
   - Example: Module A depends on B, B depends on C, C depends on A

2. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS:
   - Find tightly connected groups of friends
   - Each SCC represents a clique where everyone knows everyone
   - Used in Facebook friend suggestions, LinkedIn connections

3. WEB PAGE RANKING:
   - Group web pages that link to each other
   - Each SCC represents a cluster of related pages
   - Used in Google PageRank algorithm

4. COMPILER OPTIMIZATION:
   - Identify strongly connected regions in control flow graphs
   - Optimize code within each SCC independently
   - Loop optimization and dead code elimination

5. DATABASE QUERY OPTIMIZATION:
   - Find cycles in query dependency graphs
   - Optimize execution order for complex queries
   - Parallel execution planning

‚úÖ ALGORITHM ADVANTAGES:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Linear time complexity O(V + E)
- Works for any directed graph
- Finds all SCCs in single pass
- Memory efficient

‚ùå LIMITATIONS:
- Only works for directed graphs
- Requires two complete graph traversals
- Not suitable for dynamic graphs (frequent edge additions/deletions)
